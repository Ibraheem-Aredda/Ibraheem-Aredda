### Salutations ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Ibrahim Areda**, and I am from **Morocco** :smiley:

### My Background
I fell in love with programming because I got really curious about games :video_game: and how to make them.

As a self-taught programmer, I encountered many hardships :triumph: when I first started,
What led me to shift my attention and try other things such as web development, desktop...

I learned many valuable and precious lessons, :relieved: and built many projects throughout my journey,
and I am still excited to know more, and develop myself every chance i get. :grin:
