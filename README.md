### Salutations ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Ibrahim Areda**, and I am from **Morocco** :smiley:

### My Background
I fell in love with programming because I got really curious about games and how to make them.

As a self-taught programmer, I encountered many hardships when I first started,
What led me to shift my attention and try other things such as web development, desktop...

I learned many valuable and precious lessons, and built many projects throughout my journey,
and I am still excited to know more, and develop myself every chance i get.

### My Current Situation

Iâ€™m working on a scholar project whose purpose is to create, edit and manage BPMN diagrams through XML files,
